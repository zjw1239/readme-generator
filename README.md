## Installation:
Before running the program, load the files and run the "npm i" command in terminal. Once installation is finished run "node index.js" command to start program.

## Description:
This project is a readme.md generator. It is simply a program to save yourself some time by being able to generate the entire readme from the terminal instead of having to make the entire thing by hand and type all of the titles and headlines and styling yourself. It is very useful in the way that making readme.md files can be very time consuming and frustrating to do on top of building the entire project.

## Usage:
You would use this project to save time and dynamically generate an entire readme.md file all from your terminal. In fact this readme was generated using this program.
